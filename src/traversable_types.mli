(** The main groups of signatures provided by this module are:

    - {{!basic} Basic{i n}}: minimal definition of new modules without an
      existing [Container] instance;
    - {{!bcon} Basic{i n} _container}: minimal definition of new modules with
      an existing [Container] instance;
    - {{!s} S{i n}}: full traversable containers, produced by applying
      functors to either of the two groups.

    We also define other signatures, mostly for internal book-keeping. They
    may be useful elsewhere, however. *)

(** {3 Inner-traversal signatures}

    These signatures form the inner body of the [On] functors in the main
    signatures. They all have names ending with [_on_applicative] or
    [_on_monad], and assume the existence of a applicative functor or monad
    [M].

    While they aren't interesting on their own, they do contain (in slightly
    abstract form) the specific functions needed to build, and provided on
    building, traversable containers. *)

(** {4:omgeneric The generic signatures}

    As with {!Mappable}, we define some signatures for traversable structures
    in an arity-generic way, then specialise them for arity-0 and arity-1
    types. *)

(** [Basic_generic_on_applicative] describes traversal on either an arity-0
    or arity-1 type.

    - For arity-0 types, ['a t] becomes [t] and ['a elt] becomes [elt].
    - For arity-1 types, ['a t] becomes ['a t] and ['a elt] becomes ['a]. *)

      as ['a elt]; substitute [t]/[elt] (arity-0) or ['a t]/['a] (arity-1)
      accordingly below. *)

    of the various [On_monad] modules.

(** {3 Basic signatures}

    Any traversable type can be turned into a Base container, using the
    applicative fold to implement all container functionality. The unified
    signature of a container with traversals is {!S0} (arity 0) or {!S1}
    (arity 1).

    To satisfy these signatures for new types, implement {!Basic0} or
    {!Basic1}, and use the corresponding [MakeN] functor. Note that you must
    supply an [On] module in terms of applicatives, but not an [On_monad]
    module; previous versions of Travesty required the opposite.

    For types that are _already_ Base containers, or types where custom
    implementation of the Base signature are desired, implement
    {!Basic0_container} or {!Basic1_container}, and use the [MakeN_container]
    functors. *)
