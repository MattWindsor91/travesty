{2:top Travesty}

{i Travesty} is a library for defining containers with monadic and otherwise
'exotic' traversals, inspired by Haskell's
{i Traversable} and related typeclasses.  It sits on
top of Jane Street's Core library ecosystem.

As well as monadic traversals, Travesty includes various other
extensions on top of Core.  These focus on making a more 'purely
functional', Haskell-esque style of programming easier, though with
a focus on pragmatism over mathematical purity.

{3 Traversal interfaces}

Travesty contains module signatures, functors,
and extensions for dealing with various kinds of traversability:

- {!Travesty.Mappable}: mapping (in Haskell,
    {{:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Functor.html}functors});
- {!Travesty.Traversable}: monadic traversal (in Haskell,
    {{:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Traversable.html}traversable functors});
- {!Travesty.Bi_mappable}: mapping on two types over the same
  container (in Haskell,
    {{:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Bifunctor.html}bifunctors});
- {!Travesty.Filter_mappable}: mapping that can discard
  elements (similar to the
    {{:https://hackage.haskell.org/package/filtrable-0.1.1.0}filtrable}
    Haskell library).

Haskell's {{:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Foldable.html}foldable functors}
already exist in Base as {{:https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/base/Base/Container/index.html}Container}.

{3 State monads}

[Travesty] also contains implementations of state monads
({!Travesty.State}) and transformers
({!Travesty.State_transform}).  We use these
to implement fold-mapping and folding on top of
{!Travesty.Traversable}, but expose them for general
consumption.

{3 Extensions}

Travesty also contains extensions to various module signatures, as well as
to Base container and monad modules.  We keep the latter in sub-libraries of
[Travesty].

{4 Signature expansions}

These are in the [Travesty] library, and always have the suffix [exts].
Some Travesty signatures pull them in automatically.

- Containers ({!Travesty.Container_exts})
- Monads ({!Travesty.Monad_exts})

{4 Implementation expansions}

These are in the {!Travesty_base_exts} library.
Each usually has the same name as the
module it extends (except `Alist`), but {i doesn't} re-export that module.
The intended mode of use is:

{[
  open Base
  module Tx = Travesty_base_exts

  let example (foo : ('k, 'v) List.Assoc.t) =
    Tx.Alist.bi_map ~left:foo ~right:bar foo
]}

- {!Travesty_base_exts.Tuple2}: pairs/2-tuples
- {!Travesty_base_exts.Alist}: associative lists
- {!Travesty_base_exts.Or_error}: error monad
- {!Travesty_base_exts.Fn}: function combinators
- {!Travesty_base_exts.List}: lists
- {!Travesty_base_exts.Option}: options

{3 Custom containers}

As well as expanding various [Base] containers, [Travesty]
features some of its own.  These have various traversal and mapping features
built in, but aren't necessarily optimised for heavy-duty use.

Each is in the {!Travesty_containers} subpackage
(in Dune, use [travesty.containers].)

- {!Travesty_containers.Singleton}: treating a single data item
  like a mappable, traversable container
- {!Travesty_containers.Zipper}: list zippers

- The {{: http://binaryanalysisplatform.github.io/bap/api/odoc/monads/Monads/Std/index.html} BAP monads library}
  also contains implementations of monadic traversals, as well as several
  of [Travesty]'s other extensions.
- The {{: https://github.com/janestreet/accessor}accessor library} is an
  implementation of the related Haskell notion of 'lenses', composable
  accessors for nested functional data structures.
