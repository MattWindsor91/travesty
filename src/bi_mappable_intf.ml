(** The main groups of signatures provided by this module are:

    {ul
     {- {{!basic} Basic{i n}}: minimal definition of bi-mappable modules;}
     {- {{!s} S{i n}}: full bi-mappable containers, produced by applying
        functors to the above.}}

    We also define other signatures, mostly for internal book-keeping. They
    may be useful elsewhere, however. *)

(** {3!basic Basic signatures} *)

(** {4:generic The generic signature}

    As with {{!Traversable} Traversable}, we define the basic signature of
    bi-mappable structures in an arity-generic way, then specialise it for
    the various arities. *)

(** [Basic_generic] describes bi-mapping on any arity of type.

    - For arity-0 types, use {{!S0} S0}: [('l, 'r) t] becomes [t], ['l left]
      becomes [left], and ['r right] becomes [right].
    - For arity-1 types with a fixed right type, use {{!S1_left} S1_left}:
      [('l, 'r) t] becomes ['l t], ['l left] becomes ['l], and ['r right]
      becomes [right].
    - For arity-1 types with a fixed left type, use {{!S1_right} S1_right}:
      [('l, 'r) t] becomes ['l t], ['l left] becomes [left], and ['r right]
      becomes ['r].
    - For arity-2 types, use {{!S2} S2}: [('l, 'r) t] becomes [('l, 'r) t],
      ['l left] becomes ['l], and ['r right] becomes ['r]. *)

end

(** {4:sigs Arity-specific basic signatures}

    The basic signatures are {{!Basic0} Basic0}, which defines mapping across
    an arity-0 type [t] (with a fixed, associated element type [elt]);
    {{!Basic1_left} Basic1_left} and {{!Basic1_right} Basic1_right}, which fix
    the right and left element type respectively (leaving the named type
    floating); and {{!Basic2} Basic2}, which defines mapping across an arity-2
    type [('l, 'r) t] with left element type ['l] and right element type ['r]. *)

    floating left type and fixed right type.

    and right types. *)

    The signatures below include various functions we can derive from
    bi-mappable types. *)

  val map_right : ('l, 'r1) t -> f:('r1 right -> 'r2 right) -> ('l, 'r2) t
  (** [map_right c ~f] maps [f] over the right type of [c] only. *)
end

(** [S0] is the full signature of an arity-0 bi-mappable type.
