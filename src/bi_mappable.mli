(** Mapping for containers with two element types.

    [Bi_mappable] implements the Haskell notion of a bifunctor: a container
    that contains two distinct element types, both of which can be
    non-monadically, covariantly mapped over.

    Common examples include:

    - maps and associative lists, where the two types are keys and values;
    - result types, where the two types are success and failure. *)

(** {2 Converting bi-mappable modules to mappable modules}

    By ignoring values of either the left or the right type, we can derive
    {{!Mappable} mappable} modules from bi-mappable ones.  Since the
    various [S]{i n} signatures contain functions for doing this on an
    ad-hoc basis, the functors below are mainly for use when one needs actual
    {{!Mappable} Mappable} instances.

    This reflects the 'clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right' (the
    technical term!) set-up in Haskell; each [Map_leftX] functor implements
    a
    {{:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors/docs/Data-Bifunctor-Clown.html}
    Clown}; each [Map_rightX] functor implements a a
    {{:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors/docs/Data-Bifunctor-Joker.html}
    Joker}.

    Since, unlike Haskell, we can't partially apply type constructors in
    OCaml, there are no arity-2 conversions available, and the arity-1
    conversions only work if their direction is the one with a floating
    type. To rectify this, use {{!section:fix} Fix2_left and friends}. *)

(** {2 Chaining containers} *)

(** {3 Chaining a mappable on the outside of a bi-mappable}

    These functors let us compose an inner bi-mappable container with an
    outer mappable container, producing a bi-map.

    For example, we can make {{!Travesty_base_exts.Alist} associative lists}
    bi-mappable by composing a bi-map over
    {{!Travesty_base_exts.Tuple2} pairs} [(a * b)] with a map over
    {{!Travesty_base_exts.List} lists}.

    In Haskell terms, this is a
    {{:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors/docs/Data-Bifunctor-Tannen.html}
    Tannen}. *)
