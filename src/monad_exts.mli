(** Generic monad extensions.

    [Monad_exts] contains a signature and functor for adding various
    {{!exts} extensions} to [Base]-style monads. *)

(** {2 Signatures}

    For input and output module signatures for this module's functors, see
    {!Filter_mappable_types}. *)

(** {2:exts Extensions functors} *)

(** [Extend] creates {{!Monad_exts_types.S} extensions} for a [Monad.S]. *)
module Extend (M : Monad.S) : Monad_exts_types.S with type 'a t := 'a M.t

(** {2:misc Miscellaneous} *)

(** Like [Base.Applicative.Of_monad], but retains the type. *)
module App (M : Monad.S) : Applicative.S with type 'a t = 'a M.t

(** Demotes an arity-2 monad [M] to an arity-1 one, fixing its second type to
    be [B.t]. *)
module S2_to_S (M : Monad.S2) (B : T) :
  Monad.S with type 'a t := ('a, B.t) M.t

(** Converts a monad to a mappable over [M.map].

    At time of writing, [M] satisfies {{!Mappable_types.S1} the mappable
    interface} in its own right; this functor mainly exists as insurance in
    case the two interfaces ever diverge. *)
module To_mappable (M : Monad.S) : Mappable_types.S1 with type 'a t := 'a M.t
