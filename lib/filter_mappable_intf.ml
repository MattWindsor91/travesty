(** Signatures for filter-mapping.

    The {{!basics}basic signatures}, which contain only
   {{!filter_map}filter_map}, are {{!Basic0}Basic0} and
   {{!Basic1}Basic1}.  We also define {{!sigs}richer signatures},
   {{!S0}S0} and {{!S1}S1}, for which we provide functors in
   {{!Filter_mappable}the main interface}. *)

open Base

(** {2:basics Basic signatures}

    The basic signatures are {{!Basic0}Basic0}, which defines filtered
   mapping across an arity-0 type [t] (with a fixed, associated
   element type [elt]), and {{!Basic1}Basic1}, which defines filtered
   mapping across an arity-1 type ['a t] (with element type ['a]). *)

(** {3 The generic basic signature}

    As with {{!Traversable}Traversable} and {{!Mappable}Mappable},
    we define the basic and full signatures of
    filter-mappable structures in an arity-generic way, then specialise
    them for arity-0 and arity-1 types.

(** Generic input shape of filter-mappable structures on either an
   arity-0 or arity-1 type.

    - For arity-0 types, use {{!Basic0}Basic0}: ['a t] becomes [t],
    and ['a elt] becomes [elt];
    - For arity-1 types, use {{!Basic1}Basic1}: ['a t] becomes ['a t],
    and ['a elt] becomes ['a].  *)
