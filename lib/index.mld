{0:top Travesty}

[Travesty] is a library for defining containers with monadic traversals,
inspired by Haskell's
Traversable typeclass.  It sits on top of Jane Street's
Core library ecosystem.

Travesty's main contribution is the {{!Traversable}Traversable} module, which
implements monadic traversal.  It also includes a {{!Mappable}Mappable} module,
which adds various bits of support for mappable containers (what Haskell would
call 'functors').

Travesty also contains several other bits of Haskell-style monad functionality:

- state monads ({{!State}State});
- state transformers ({{!State_transform}State_transform});
- miscellaneous extensions on monads
  ({{!T_monad}T_monad}), containers ({{!T_containers}T_containers}),
  and functions ({{!T_fn}T_fn}).
