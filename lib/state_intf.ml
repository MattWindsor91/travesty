(** Haskell-style state monads

    State monads form a way to thread a modifiable, readable state
   record through a computation without resorting to mutability.  At
   any point in a state-monad computation, we can [peek] at the
   present value of the state, or [modify] it, or do both.

    We provide two signatures for state monads: one corresponding to
   the situation where the state type is fixed at the module level
   ([S]), and one leaving the state type as part of the monad type
   ([S2]).  [S] has a corresponding make functor; [S2] has a direct
   implementation ([M2]).

    We also provide a functor [To_S] for fixing the state type in an
    arity-2 monad after the fact. *)
