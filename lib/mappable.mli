(** Non-monadic mapping.

    [Mappable] contains signatures and extensions for types that
    can be (non-monadically) mapped over.  It resembles the Haskell (but not
    the OCaml!) notion of a functor, though we call the mapping function
    [map].  *)

(** {2 Signatures} *)

(** {{!Mappable_intf}Mappable_intf} contains the signatures for
    [Mappable]. *)
include module type of Mappable_intf

(** {2 Extending mappable containers}

    We define several derived functions for mappable containers in
    {{!Mappable_intf}Mappable_intf}---here, we define functors to generate
    them. *)

(** [Extend1] implements [Extensions1] for an arity-1 mappable
     container. *)
module Extend1 (S : S1_container) : Extensions1 with type 'a t := 'a S.t
