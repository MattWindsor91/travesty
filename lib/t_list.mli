(** List extensions.

    This module contains various extensions for Core's [List] module,
   including adding monadic traversal. *)

open Base

(** [t] is just [list], re-exported to make this module satisfy
    various container interfaces. *)
type 'a t = 'a list

(** Lists are traversable containers. *)
include Traversable.S1_container with type 'a t := 'a t

(** We can also filter-map over them. *)
include Filter_mappable.S1 with type 'a t := 'a t

(** {2 Miscellaneous extension functions} *)

val prefixes : 'a t -> 'a t t
(** [prefixes xs] returns all non-empty prefixes of [xs].

    Examples:

    {[
      prefixes [1; 2; 3] (* [ [ 1 ]; [ 1; 2 ]; [ 1; 2; 3 ] *)
    ]}
