(** List extensions.

    This module contains various extensions for Core's [List] module,
   including adding monadic traversal. *)

open Base

type 'a t = 'a list
(** [t] is just [list], re-exported to make this module satisfy
    various container interfaces. *)

include Traversable.S1_container with type 'a t := 'a t
(** Lists are traversable containers. *)

include Filter_mappable.S1 with type 'a t := 'a t
(** We can also filter-map over them. *)


(** {2 Miscellaneous extension functions} *)

val prefixes : 'a t -> 'a t t
(** [prefixes xs] returns all non-empty prefixes of [xs].

    Examples:

    {[
      prefixes [1; 2; 3] (* [ [ 1 ]; [ 1; 2 ]; [ 1; 2; 3 ] *)
    ]}
*)

val one : 'a list -> 'a Or_error.t
(** [one xs] returns [Ok x] if [xs] is a list containing only [x],
    and an error otherwise.

    Examples:

    {[
      one []     (* error -- not enough *)
      one [1]    (* ok 1 *)
      one [1; 2] (* error -- too many *)
    ]}
*)

val two : 'a list -> ('a * 'a) Or_error.t
(** [two xs] returns [Ok (x, y)] if [xs] is a list containing only [x]
    and [y] in that order, and an error otherwise.

    Examples:

    {[
      two []        (* error -- not enough *)
      two [1]       (* error -- not enough *)
      two [1; 2]    (* ok (1, 2) *)
      two [1; 2; 3] (* error -- too many *)
    ]}
*)
