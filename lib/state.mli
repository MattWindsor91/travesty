(** Haskell-style state monads.

    State monads are a way to thread a modifiable, readable state
    record through a computation without resorting to mutability.  At
    any point in a state-monad computation, we can [peek] at the
    present value of the state, or [modify] it, or do both.

    We provide two signatures for state monads: one corresponding to
    the situation where the state type is fixed at the module level
    ({{!S}S}), and one leaving the state type as part of the monad type
    ({{!S2}S2}).  The former has a corresponding {{!Make}make functor};
    the latter has a {{!M2}direct implementation}.

    We also provide a functor {{!To_S}To_S} for fixing the state type in an
    arity-2 monad after the fact. *)

(** {2 Relation to state transformers}

    Like in Haskell, state monads are a special case of
    {{!State_transform}state transformers}, corresponding to the application
    of those transformers to the identity monad.

    If you need to run stateful computations that can fail, or are partial,
    or non-deterministic, and so on, use state transformers instead. *)

(** {2 Signatures} *)

(** {{!State_intf}State_intf} contains the signatures for [State]. *)
include module type of State_intf

(** {2 Manipulating state monads} *)

(** [To_S] flattens a {{!S2}S2} into an {{!S}S} by fixing the state type
      to [B.t]. *)
module To_S (M : S2) (B : Base.T) :
  S with type state = B.t and type 'a t = ('a, B.t) M.t

(** {2 Implementations and functors} *)

(** [Make] makes an [S] (state monad with fixed state type) from a single state
    type. *)
module Make (B : Base.T) : S with type state = B.t

(** [M2] is a basic implementation of {{!S2}S2} (state monad with variable
    state type). *)
module M2 : S2
