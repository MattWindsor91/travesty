(** Generic monad extensions.

    [T_monad] contains a signature and functor for adding various
    {{!exts} extensions} to [Core]-style monads. *)

open Base

(** {2:exts Extensions} *)

(** [Extensions] contains extensions for a [Monad.S].

    To create an instance of [Extensions], use {{!Extend} Extend}. *)
module type Extensions = sig
  (** The type of the extended monad. *)
  type 'a t

  val when_m : bool -> f:(unit -> unit t) -> unit t
  (** [when_m predicate ~f] returns [f ()] when [predicate] is true, and
      [return ()] otherwise. *)

  val unless_m : bool -> f:(unit -> unit t) -> unit t
  (** [unless_m predicate ~f] returns [f ()] when [predicate] is false, and
      [return ()] otherwise. *)

  val tee_m : 'a -> f:('a -> unit t) -> 'a t
  (** [tee_m val ~f] executes [f val] for its monadic action, then returns
      [val].

      Example:

      {[
        let fail_if_negative x =
          T_on_error.when_m (Int.is_negative x)
            ~f:(fun () -> Or_error.error_string "value is negative!")
        in
        Or_error.(
          42 |> T_on_error.tee_m ~f:fail_if_negative >>| (fun x -> x * x)
        ) (* Ok (1764) *)
      ]} *)
end

(** [Extend] creates {{!Extensions} Extensions} for a [Monad.S]. *)
module Extend (M : Monad.S) : Extensions with type 'a t := 'a M.t

(** {2:misc Miscellaneous} *)

(** Demotes an arity-2 monad [M] to an arity-1 one, fixing its second type
    to be [B.t]. *)
module S2_to_S (M : Monad.S2) (B : T) :
  Monad.S with type 'a t := ('a, B.t) M.t

(** Converts a monad to a mappable over [M.map].

    At time of writing, [M] satisfies
    {{!Mappable.S1} the mappable interface} in its own right; this functor
    mainly exists as insurance in case the two interfaces ever diverge. *)
module To_mappable (M : Monad.S) : Mappable.S1 with type 'a t := 'a M.t
