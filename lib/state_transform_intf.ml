(** Haskell-style state monad transformers

    State monad transformers generalise state monads.  They attach
   onto an existing monad, and allow the stateful computations to
   return and handle values inside that monad.  For example,
   transforming [On_error] provides stateful, potentially-failing
   computations.

    We provide two signatures for state transformers: one
   corresponding to the situation where the state type is fixed at the
   module level ([S]), and one leaving the state type as part of the
   monad type (S2).  Each has a corresponding make.

    We also provide a functor, [To_S], for fixing the state type in an
   arity-2 monad after the fact.  *)
