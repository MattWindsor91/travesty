(** Option extensions.

    This module contains various extensions for Core's [Option] module,
    including adding monadic traversal. *)

(** [t] is just [option], re-exported to make this module satisfy various
    container interfaces. *)
type 'a t = 'a option

(** Options are traversable containers. *)
include Traversable.S1_container with type 'a t := 'a t

(** Options are also filter-mappable; filter-mapping effectively behaves as
    monadic bind. *)
include Filter_mappable.S1 with type 'a t := 'a t

(** {2 Miscellaneous extension functions} *)

val first_some_of_thunks : (unit -> 'a t) list -> 'a t
(** [first_some_of_thunks thunks] evaluates each thunk in [thunks] until
    none remain (in which case, it returns [None], or one of the thunks
    returns [Some x] (in which case, it returns [Some x]. *)
