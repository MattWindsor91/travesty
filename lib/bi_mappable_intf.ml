(** Signatures for (non-monadic) bi-mapping.

    The {{!sigs}main signatures} are {{!S2}S2}, {{!S1_left}S1_left},
    {{!S1_right}S1_right}, and {{!S0}S0}
    We also define various {{!exts}extension signatures}. *)

open Base

(** {2:generic The generic signature}

    As with {{!Traversable}Traversable}, we define the signature of
    bi-mappable structures in an arity-generic way, then specialise
    it for the various arities.
*)

(** [Generic] describes bi-mapping on any arity of type.

    - For arity-0 types, use {{!S0}S0}: [('l, 'r) t] becomes [t],
      ['l left] becomes [left], and ['r right] becomes [right].
    - For arity-1 types with a fixed right type, use
      {{!S1_left}S1_left}: [('l, 'r) t] becomes ['l t],
      ['l left] becomes ['l], and ['r right] becomes [right].
    - For arity-1 types with a fixed left type, use
      {{!S1_right}S1_right}: [('l, 'r) t] becomes ['l t],
      ['l left] becomes [left], and ['r right] becomes ['r].
    - For arity-2 types, use
      {{!S2}S2}: [('l, 'r) t] becomes [('l, 'r) t],
      ['l left] becomes ['l], and ['r right] becomes ['r].

(** {2:sigs Basic signatures}

    The basic signatures are {{!S0}S0}, which defines mapping across an
    arity-0 type [t] (with a fixed, associated element type [elt]);
    {{!S1_left}S1_left} and {{!S1_right}S1_right}, which fix the
    right and left element type respectively (leaving the named type
    floating); and
    {{!S2}S2}, which defines mapping across an arity-2 type [('l, 'r) t]
    with left element type ['l] and right element type ['r]. *)

   types. *)
