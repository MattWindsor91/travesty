(** Lifting a item to a singleton container.

    [Singleton] lifts a single item to a traversable container, and is
    useful for passing one item to functors and other contexts that expect
    a container. *)

(** ['a t] is just ['a], but made to look like a container type.
    If its inner type is sexpable, it is too. *)
type 'a t = 'a [@@deriving sexp]

(** We implement {{!Traversable.S1_container}S1_container}, and, by extension,
    the Core container interface. *)
include Traversable.S1_container with type 'a t := 'a t
