(** Associative-list extensions. *)

(** Defined to let this module be used directly in chaining operations etc. *)
type ('k, 'v) t = ('k, 'v) Base.List.Assoc.t

(** Associative lists are bi-traversable (and therefore bi-mappable); the
    left type is keys, and the right type is values.

    Here is an example of bi-mapping:

    {[
        bi_map [("foo", 27); ("bar", 53); ("baz", 99)]
          ~left:String.capitalize ~right:Int.neg
        (* returns: [("Foo", -27); ("Bar", -53); ("Baz", -99)] *)
    ]} *)
include Travesty.Bi_traversable.S2 with type ('l, 'r) t := ('l, 'r) t

val compose :
  ('a, 'b) t -> ('b, 'c) t -> equal:('b -> 'b -> bool) -> ('a, 'c) t
(** [compose a b ~equal] produces an associative list that returns [(x, z)]
    for each [(x, y)] in [a] such that a [(y', z)] exists in [b], and
    [equal y y'] is true. *)
