(** Miscellaneous function combinators.

    [Fn] contains various higher-order functions in the style of Base's [Fn]
    module. *)

(** {2 Constant predicates}

    These are convenience shorthands for [Base.Fn.const]. *)

val always : 'a -> bool
(** [always x] is [true]. *)

val never : 'a -> bool
(** [never x] is [false]. *)

(** {2 Pointwise liftings of operators}

    These complement [Base.Fn.non]. *)

val conj : ('a -> bool) -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> bool
(** [conj f g] lifts [&&] over predicates [f] and [g]. It is
    short-circuiting: [g] is never called if [f] returns false.

    Examples:

    {[
      let is_zero = Int.(conj is_non_negative is_non_positive)
    ]}
    {[
      (* Short-circuiting: *)
      conj always (fun () -> failwith "oops") () ;
      (* --> exception *)
      conj never (fun () -> failwith "oops") ()

      (* --> false *)
    ]} *)

val disj : ('a -> bool) -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> bool
(** [disj f g] lifts [||] over predicates [f] and [g]. It is
    short-circuiting: [g] is never called if [f] returns true.

    Examples:

    {[
      let is_not_zero = Int.(disj is_negative is_positive)
    ]}
    {[
      (* Short-circuiting: *)
      disj never (fun () -> failwith "oops") () ;
      (* --> exception *)
      disj always (fun () -> failwith "oops") ()

      (* --> false *)
    ]} *)

val ( &&& ) : ('a -> bool) -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> bool
(** [f &&& g] is [conj f g]. *)

val ( ||| ) : ('a -> bool) -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> bool
(** [f ||| g] is [disj f g]. *)

(** {2 Miscellaneous combinators} *)

val on : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'a -> f:('b -> 'b -> 'r) -> 'r
(** [on lift x y ~f] lifts a binary function [f] using the lifter [lift]. It
    does the same thing as the `on` function from Haskell, but with arguments
    flipped to make sense without infixing.

    Effectively, it's [Base.Comparable.lift], but with a slightly different
    signature.

    Example:

    {[
      let ints = on fst ~f:Int.equal (42, "banana") (42, "apple") in
      let strs = on snd ~f:String.equal (42, "banana") (42, "apple") in
      (ints, strs)

      (* --> true, false *)
    ]} *)

(** {2 F# style function composition operator}

    This is in a separate module to reduce the ambiguity caused by its use. *)

module Compose_syntax : sig
  val ( >> ) : ('a -> 'b) -> ('b -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'c
  (** [f >> g] is [Fn.compose g f].

      Example:

      {[
        let f = String.(Compose_syntax.(strip >> lowercase >> equal "test")
        in f " TEST " (* --> true *)
      ]} *)
end
